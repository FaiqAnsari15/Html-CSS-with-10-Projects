                <h2>Pakistani nuclear physicist</h2>
                <p><b>Abdul Qadeer Khan</b>, revered as the father of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, died on Sunday.He was lauded in Pakistan for transforming it into the world’s first Islamic nuclear weapons power. But he was seen by the West as a dangerous renegade responsible for smuggling technology to rogue states.He was seen as a national hero for bringing the country up to par with neighbours India in the atomic field and making its defences “impregnable”.But he found himself in the crosshairs of controversy when he was accused of illegally proliferating nuclear technology to Iran, Libya and North Korea.Khan was placed under effective house arrest in Islamabad in 2004 after he admitted running a proliferation network to the three countries.In 2006 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but recovered after surgery. 
                  A court ended his house arrest in February 2009, but his movements were strictly guarded, and he was accompanied by authorities every time he left his home in an upmarket sector of leafy Islamabab.The nuclear scientist died at 85 in the capital, Islamabad, after recently being hospitalised with COVID-19.
